<h1>Jeykll and Hyde Collide</h1>

<h2>The Game</h2>
<p>This is a simple Unity 2d game for a games jam we've been working on.  The game is based around the theme of "change" and is completely open source.</p>

<p>The repo is the un-consolidated, un-compiled unity project files for ease of access during development</p>

<h2>The Guys</h2>
<p>A php developer, a WPF developer and a flash animatior walk into a bar.... It sounds like a joke but the end result isn't that funny.  Those accountable for this repo's content are:
<ul>
<li>Kane Burton - animation quirks? spam him.</li>
<li>Sam Higton - gotta take flack for the level generation</li>
<li>Jon Wells - this man is to blame for the character behaviours</li>
</ul>
